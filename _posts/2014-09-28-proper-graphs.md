I recently came across an [interesting graphic](http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/663618/Donating.vs.Death-Graph.0.jpg), but I was left with more questions than answers.

The most important question to answer when visualizing or analyzing data is: am I creating the correct mental model into my readers head? I do not think that this infographic does. First, the infographic uses radius-based circles to represent differnences. Humans are good at length comparisons, average at area comparisons, and weak at everything else.

Furthermore, the infographic only covers a single fundraising program per cause, which warps the analysis into punishing programs that are the most successful.

In either case, here is my [redesign of the infographic](http://i.imgur.com/98qOhrW.png). What I would really like is a better data source so we can properly compare which causes have the most immediate need.
